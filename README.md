# 🏠 ALX Listing App

## 📖 Project Description
The **ALX Listing App** is the foundation of an **Airbnb clone** project, created as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program.  

This milestone focuses on **scaffolding the project** by:  
- Setting up a **Next.js app** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS  
- Creating a **well-structured folder layout**  
- Preparing the app for future development of the **listing page**  

⚡ At this stage, no business logic or UI implementation has been added. The focus is on setting up a **maintainable and scalable codebase**.
